create more boolean features from numerical distributions if appropriate. could've created an moneyspent feature.
look more at joint distributions to fill missing values in a smarter way. also helps in cases of hidden correlations from correlation matrix
check more properties of missing values. maximum amount of missing in rows
apply standard scaler after log transform to force mean 0 and std-dev 1
only choose most important parameters for grid search. i went overboard
try Catboost model next time
be strict with the choosing of final models. Only Catboost and LightGBM works fine here
potentially change classification threshold based on model bias
don't only look at correlation. it's sometimes misleading and should also look at mutual information or visually do EDA
