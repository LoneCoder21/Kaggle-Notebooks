deal with and remove multicollinearity features
deal with huge outliers and remove them (IQR method and/or with scatter plots)
use models to deal with outliers (Lasso/Ridge)
compute and check skew of features
log transform the skewed features
additional feature engineering by doing log/sqrt/x^2
consider stackingcvregressor and/or votingclassifier
consider using RobustScaler for outliers instead of just StandardScaler
